### Used Components

The following parts of the Antigravity Kit are embedded and managed by AGEN:

- **Agent Personas**: The definition files for specialist agents (e.g., `project-planner`, `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`) located in `.agent/agents/`.
- **Skills**: The domain-specific knowledge modules (e.g., `api-patterns`, `clean-code`, `security-auditor`) located in `.agent/skills/`.
- **Workflows**: The slash-command workflows (e.g., `/brainstorm`, `/deploy`) located in `.agent/workflows/`.
- **Methodologies**: The 4-Phase workflow (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation) and the "Agentic Mode" concepts.

We express our gratitude to Vudovn and the Antigravity Kit community for creating this comprehensive framework for AI agent capabilities.
